# Password Manager

This repository contains a minimal password manager built with Angular 20.
It generates deterministic passwords using SHA-256 and allows the user to
export or import an encrypted list of generated records.

## Current status

- Angular application using standalone components.
- Password generation and configuration encryption implemented.
- Basic tests with Karma and Jasmine.
- UI uses Angular Material for global styling.

## Next steps

- Persist records locally using IndexedDB or another storage.
- Add password strength options and generation levels.
- Provide a history screen to manage exported records.
- Improve automated tests and CI configuration.
